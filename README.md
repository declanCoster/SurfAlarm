# SurfAlarm
This is a repository of making a surfing alarm for a telegram group chat.

The necessary changes are commented or left empty where needed.

This code needs a storm glass api account and a telegram bot must already be created.

The test file is used to run as a way to check connection to the bot and the group chat. 

The bot must be added to the chat and the chat id is needed for the code.
